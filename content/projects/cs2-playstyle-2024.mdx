# Executive Summary

**Project Goal:** To determine if player "roles" in Counter-Strike are measurable behavioural archetypes that can be classified using machine learning, rather than just theoretical concepts.

**Key Outcomes:**
*   **Data Processing & Feature Engineering:** Processed over 1,000 match replay files (>400GB) to engineer a robust dataset of behavioural features, representing aspects of 'playstyle' such as aggression, trading, and positioning.
*   **Quantifying Behaviour:** Used statistical analysis to formally model behavioural differences across roles, providing empirical validation for domain intuition (e.g. verifying how specific roles differ in positioning) while uncovering novel insights.
*   **Role Classification:** Developed a supervised learning model as a proof-of-concept for automating role labelling. Achieved an **~92% F1-Macro score** (T-Side), demonstrating that player roles are statistically distinct and enabling the algorithmic identification of mislabelled data.

**Potential Utility:** This framework offers a scalable method for automated role labelling, applicable when manual annotation is unfeasible, such as on commercial analytics platforms or for large datasets.
