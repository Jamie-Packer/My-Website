<h1 className="font-heading">The Story of This Website</h1>

I built this website from the ground up to serve as my personal hub on the internet, showcasing my projects and articles. My goal was to create a fast, dynamic, and modern site without relying on a pre-built solution like Squarespace.

The development followed an **iterative cycle**, breaking the project down into manageable phases. After completing each phase, such as setting up the foundational components or building the content system, the changes were immediately deployed to Vercel. This process of **continuous delivery** ensured the live site was always functional and up-to-date with the latest features, allowing for regular progress checks and a less daunting overall development experience.

<h2 className="font-heading">Technical Stack</h2>

This project is built on a modern, robust set of technologies, chosen for their performance and flexibility.

- **Next.js**: The core framework for its routing and server-side rendering capabilities.
- **TypeScript**: Used throughout the codebase to ensure type safety and improve code quality.
- **React**: The library that powers all the user interface components.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: The styling framework used for its utility-first approach, which allows for rapid, consistent UI development.
- **Vercel**: The platform used for seamless deployment and hosting, providing a smooth path from development to production.

<h2 className="font-heading">Future Plans</h2>

I'm always looking to improve and expand this site. Some of my plans for the future include:

- **Implementing a contact form**: To make it easy for people to get in touch.
- **Considering a content database**: As the amount of content grows, I may explore migrating from local MDX files to an external database to improve content management and scalability.
- **SEO Optimization**: Implementing better meta descriptions and titles for each page to improve search engine visibility.
- **Adding more content**: The most important next step is to populate the site with more projects and articles!
