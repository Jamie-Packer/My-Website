 # Introduction

In this write-up I have put together a selection of coursework from the relevant modules in my second and third years of university.
This isn't all the project work I did at university, just some highlights.

The featured work is broken the work down by year and by module, each with atleast a description of what was involved. I have omitted first year modules since they're elementary and also heavily statistical modules since their coursework was not so relevant to data science.
