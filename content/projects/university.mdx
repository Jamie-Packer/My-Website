 # Introduction

In this write-up I have put together a **selection of coursework from the relevant modules** in my second and third years of university.
This isn't all the project work I did at university, just an overview of the relevant project-type work.

The featured work is broken the work down by year and by module, each with atleast a description of what was involved. I have omitted first year modules since they're elementary and also heavily statistical modules since their coursework was not so relevant to data science.

For my final-year project (equivalent of a dissertation) I tackled a problem in a space I’m genuinely passionate about: using data science to understand professional Counter-Strike (the videogame). The project set out to measure the link between playstyles (how a player plays the game) and roles (the responsibilities they are expected to fulfil in a team).

#### TL;DR
The analysis showed that **data-driven playstyle profiles meaningfully align with expert role labels** while also revealing fluidity and overlap in how roles manifest.
To achieve this, I designed a bespoke workflow to process ~400GB of raw match data, engineered **custom features**, and applied a mix of **EDA**,
**linear regression analysis**, **basic classification**, and multiple **clustering methods** analysing their quality metrics (**Silhouette, Calinski–Harabasz, NMI, ARI**).

  #### Data Processing

  To do this, I built a bespoke data processing workflow. Starting with over 400GB of raw "demofiles" (gameplay data) from tournaments in 2024, I used the <a href="https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/awpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awpy</a> python library to parse the game events and then engineered a bespoke set of behavioural features. These weren’t performance metrics like K/D — they were designed to quantify *how* a player approached the game, not *how well*:

  - Aggression (time alive per death, opening duel attempts)  
  - Trading (proportion of kills and deaths traded)  
  - Positioning (two novel distance-based metrics I developed to capture how close players stayed to their teammates)

  All processing was done locally in python, with careful validation (manual demo checks and cross-referencing HLTV stats) to ensure the features were robust. The result was a clean player-level dataset representing playstyle alone.

  #### Data analysis methodology

  I carried out extensive exploratory analysis on the engineered features. This included stability checks to ensure they were consistent across sufficient samples, **correlation analysis** to study relationships between them, and analysed a **linear regression stratified by role** on the positional metrics to determine whether both captured distinct information. I also ran preliminary classification experiments with **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forests** to test how well the features could predict role labels. Throughout this process I generated a large number of plots — distributions, correlations, regressions, and role comparisons — to visualise and validate the behaviour of the features.

  I then moved on to several **clustering methods** (**K-Means**, **Hierarchical**, **Gaussian Mixture Models**) to see if natural “archetypes” emerged. Cluster quality was assessed using internal validation metrics such as the **Silhouette Coefficient** and **Calinski–Harabasz Index**, while external comparison with expert-assigned role labels was quantified using **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)** and the **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**. Together, these steps created a rigorous analytical framework that contextualised the clustering results and highlighted both the structure and limitations of the data.

  #### Interpretations

  The analysis showed clear spectra for rifler roles, distinct separation of snipers (AWPers), and measurable though overlapping groupings that aligned with expert role labels from the CS community. **In short, I was able to demonstrate that with just a few carefully engineered features, data-driven playstyle profiles corresponded with how analysts describe roles**, while also highlighting ambiguities and role fluidity. **T-side roles proved more distinguishable than the CT-side**, where playstyles were less separable and clusters weaker — a finding that mirrors the greater individual flexibility demanded on the defensive side. Notably, **T-side AWPers consistently formed the most distinct cluster**, showing that their behavioural signature was strong enough to emerge from positioning and engagement patterns alone. Meanwhile, rifler roles often appeared along spectra (e.g. Spacetaker ↔ Lurker, Anchor ↔ Rotator) rather than as discrete groups, reinforcing that **playstyles exist on a continuum rather than in fixed categories**.

  #### Conclusion

  This project gave me experience with a full data workflow — messy raw data acquisition, custom feature engineering, validation, clustering, and analysis — and produced a unique dataset and methodology in a field that hasn’t seen much academic work yet. It was the most meaningful piece of coursework I did, combining technical depth with a domain I have relative expertise in.
